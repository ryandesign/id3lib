1999-12-04  Scott Thomas Haug  <sth2@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/id3/tag_parse_v1.cpp
	(ParseID3v1): Added STR_V1_COMMENT_DESC as description parameter to 
	call to ID3_AddComment 

	* include/id3/misc_support.h: 
	Updated the Add functions so that they accept an option boolean
	parameter which indicates if the function should replace the current

	(ID3_AddArtist): Added extra boolean parameter (see changes for
	misc_support.h above) as well as the functionality that implements the

1999-11-30  Scott Thomas Haug  <sth2@cs.wustl.edu>

	* README:
	Renamed ID3Lib to id3lib.

	* COPYING: 
	Renamed ID3Lib to id3lib.  Fixed spelling of "optimizations".

	* configure.in: 
	Minor modifications.  Removed call to SH_SIZE_SPECIFIC_TYPES---these
	types are now defined in src/id3/sized_types.h.  Removed ID3LIB_NAME
	macro (same as PACKAGE).  Removed ID3LIB_RELEASE macro (same as 
	VERSION).  Renamed ID3LIB_IDSTRING to ID3LIB_FULLNAME and removed
	the date part of it.

	* Makefile.am
	(EXTRA_DIST): Removed ChangeLog, configure, HISTORY, and TODO.  
	These are included in the distribution automatically.

	* configure.in: 
	Generalized versioning mechanism so it only has to be changed in this
	file to be propagated throughout rest of source code.  Used a hack to
	make libtool version coincide with release versioning.  This is
	expressly warned against in the libtool docs, so it might be changed.
	However, it also seems to be a common practice amongst other library
	writers, so I'm torn.  Added versioning macro definitions normally
	found in version.h.  Probably not the best place for this...

	* src/id3/version.cpp: 
	Added.  Implements version functions declared in version.h.

	* src/id3/sized_types.h: 
	Added.  Converted from sh_types.h in toplevel m4 directory.  Defines
	size-specific types based on macros in limits.h.  int8, uint8, int16,
	uint16, int32, uint32.

	* src/id3/version.h: 
	Changed from preprocessor macros to functions.  Now changes to top
	level configure.in with regards to version info will be reflected in
	these functions without having to change this file.

	* src/id3/types.h
	* src/id3/misc_support.h: 
	Removed include for wchar.h

	* src/id3/misc_support.cpp: 
	No more SIZE_SPECIFIC_TYPES code.  No more code for wchar's.  Typedefs
	in sized_types.h guarantee that unicode_t will be two bytes.

	* src/id3/globals.h: 
	No longer includes config.h.  No more SIZE_SPECIFIC_TYPES code.  No
	more code for wchar_t.  Added include for sized_types.h.

	* src/id3/Makefile.am
	(the_headers): Added sized_headers.h
	(the_sources): Added version.cpp
	(LTVERSION): Updated to make use of configure.in variables.

	* src/examples/demo_info.cpp
	* src/examples/demo_convert.cpp: 
	Updated to reflect changes from version macros to version functions.

	* m4/Makefile.am
	(m4macros): Removed sh_types.m4.

	* m4/sh_types.m4:
	Removed.  Content now in src/id3/sized_types.h (a more appropriate
	file).

	(the_headers): Added globals.h to header file listing.

	* src/id3/misc_support.h: 
	Renamed ID3_ASCIItoUnicode to mbstoucs.  Renamed ID3_UnicodeToASCII to
	ucstombs.  Added declarations for ucslen, ucscpy, ucsncpy, ucscmp, and
	ucsncmp.

	* src/id3/globals.h: 
	Updated documentation to work better with doc++ (probably doesn't work
	well with kdoc anymore).  Added the unicode_t typedef.

	* src/id3/version.h: 
	Updated documentation to work better with doc++ (probably doesn't work
	well with kdoc anymore).  Updated the constants.

	* src/id3/misc_support.cpp: 
	(): Made includsion of wchar.h dependant on SIZE_SPECIFIC_TYPES.
	Put in compile-time checks to compile differently based on the 
	definition of unicode_t.
	(mbstoucs): Renamed from ID3_ASCIItoUnicode.  
	(ucstombs): Renamed from ID3_UnicodeToASCII.

	(ucscmp): Added.  Compares two unicode strings.
	(ucsncmp): Added.  Compares the first n chars of two unicode strings.

	* src/id3/tag_find.cpp: 
	(): Updated methods to use unicode_t instead of wchar_t.  unicode_t is
	defined in globals.h.  The type unicode_t is more likely to be two
	bytes on every platform.  Updated calls to unicode methods to more
	general methods defined in misc_support.cpp.

	* src/id3/field_string_unicode.cpp
	(): Updated methods to use unicode_t instead of wchar_t.  unicode_t is
	defined in globals.h.  The type unicode_t is more likely to be two
	bytes on every platform.  Updated calls to unicode methods to more
	general methods defined in misc_support.cpp.
	(ParseUnicodeString): Fixed a bug (?) to make unicode parsing work.
	Not really sure if this is the source of the bug, or if there is a
	more pervasive misunderstanding of the format of unicode.  Need to 
	check on this.

	* src/id3/field_string_ascii.cpp: 
	Updated methods to use unicode_t instead of wchar_t.  unicode_t is
	defined in globals.h.  The type unicode_t is more likely to be two
	bytes on every platform.  Updated calls to unicode methods to more
	general methods defined in misc_support.cpp.

	* src/id3/field.cpp: 
	Updated methods to use unicode_t instead of wchar_t.  unicode_t is
	defined in globals.h.  The type unicode_t is more likely to be two
	bytes on every platform.

	* src/id3/error.h
	* src/id3/field.h
	* src/id3/frame.h
	* src/id3/tag.h:
	Updated documentation to work better with doc++ (probably doesn't work
	well with kdoc anymore).

	* src/id3/dll.h
	* src/id3/dll_wrapper.cpp: 
	Updated unicode function declarations to now pass unicode_t instead of
	wchar_t.  unicode_t now defined in globals.h.

	Removed refs to removed files.
	
	* doc/Makefile.am
	(SUBDIRS): Added.

	* m4/sh_types.m4:

	(class ID3_Tag): Changed the interface to AddFrame slightly.  Now there
	is two AddTag-like methods: AddTag and AddNewTag.  The former merely
	attaches the frame to the tag without taking repsonsibility for 
	deallocating the frame when the tag goes out of scope or is deleted.
	The latter does take this responsibility.  Granted, there could be a
	better interface for this, but it works for now...  Update and Strip
	now return flags which indicate what tags were actually updated or
	stripped.  Removed OpenLinkedFile method; replaced with 
	OpenFileForReading, OpenFileForWriting, and CreateFile.

	* src/id3/frame.h: 
	Added doc++/kdoc/javadoc-like documentation, mostly transcribed
	from Dirk's ID3Lib Documentation MSWord doc.
	
	* src/id3/field.h
	(): Added doc++/kdoc/javadoc-like documentation, mostly transcribed
	from Dirk's ID3Lib Documentation MSWord doc.
	(ID3_FieldFlags ): Created enumeration to replace generic constants.
	(ID3_FieldID): Removed.  Replaced in globals.h.
	(ID3_FrameID): Removed.  Replaced in globals.h.
	(class ID3_Field): Made the constructor private.

	* src/id3/error.h 
	(): Added doc++/kdoc/javadoc-like documentation.
	(ID3_Err): Added error types SmallBuffer and ReadOnly.

	* src/id3/misc_support.cpp: 
	Replaced every call to AddFrame with AddNewFrame.

	* src/id3/tag_render.cpp
	(Render): Replaced manual array initialization with call to memset.
	(GenerateTempName): Removed method.  No longer used.
	(RenderV1): New method.  Renders an id3v1 tag to an array.
	(RenderV1ToHandle): Moved work of writing tag to array to RenderV1.
	(RenderV2ToHandle): Rather than generating a temporary file name with
	mktemp (or similar) and opening that file name to a temporary file,
	we now use tmpfile to create a temporary file directly.  Unfortunately,
	this means we can't just rename the tempfile to the original file
	when all the copying is done, so we have to perform a second copy from
	the temp file back to the original.  This makes the code less efficient
	but more portable, as we rely on tmpfile for knowing where to create
	the temporary file.  To improve, we'll need to figure out a portable
	mechanism for creating temporary files (i.e., resolve the differences
	between /tmp/ and C:\temp\).

	* src/id3/tag_parse.cpp 
	(ProcessBinaries): Minor code reorg.

	* src/id3/tag_file.cpp
	(OpenLinkedFile): Removed method.  Replaced with CreateFile,
	OpenFileForReading, and OpenFileForWriting.
	(CreateFile): New method.  Creates a new file with file name sFileName.
	Throws if unable to.
	(OpenFileForWriting): New method.  Opens a file with write permissions.
	Throws if unable to.
	(OpenFileForReading): New method.  Opens a file with read permissions.
	Throws if unable to.
	(CloseFile): New method.  Closes a file.  Returns true if successful,
	false otherwise.
	(Link): Now dynamically allocate sFileName.  Make use of new method
	OpenFileForReading rather than OpenLinkedFile.  Closes the file
	when done.
	(Update): Now returns a flag indicating which tags were actually
	written.  Calls OpenFileForWriting to open the file appropriately.
	Closes the file when done.
	(Strip): Now returns a flag indicating which tags were actually
	written.  Now strips a file "in place," by copying the non-stripped
	information to the beginning of the file and using ftruncate to chop
	off the rest.  Prevents having to create a temporary file.  Calls
	OpenFileForWriting to open the file appropriately.  Closes the file
	when done.

	* src/id3/tag.cpp 
	(SetupTag): Initialized sFileName to NULL rather than the empty string
	to indicate no filename is present.
	(ID3_Tag): Deleted sFileName if allocated.  Added call to CloseFile.
	(AddFrame): Modified to reflect change in interface.  AddFrame now adds
	a frame without taking responsibility for deallocating the memory when
	the tag goes out of scope.
	(AddNewFrame): New method.  AddNewFrame adds a frame and takes 
	responsibility for deallocating the frame when the tag goes out of 
	scope.

	* src/id3/error.cpp 
	(ID3_ErrorDescs): Added descriptions for new error types.
	(ID3_Error): Minor bugfix in string copying.

	* src/id3/dll.h: 
	Removed many of the enums and typedefs to globals.h to reduce 
	redundancy.

	* src/id3/globals.h: 
	Added.  Includes constants, typedefs, and enums common to several
	files that were redundantly copying them.

	* src/examples/Makefile.am: 
	Removed demo_strip from the make rules.

	* src/examples/demo_strip.cpp: 
	Removed.  Functionality now in demo_convert.cpp with the -s flag.
	
	* src/examples/demo_convert.cpp
	(PrintUsage): Added for printing usage information.
	(PrintVersion): Added for printing version information.
	(DisplayTags): Added for printing out the contents of a tag flag.
	(main): Modified to make use of command-line options via option.h.  
	Can now choose which type of tag to convert to, can convert multiple
	tags at once.  Can print out usage and version info.  Added stripping
	capabilities with the -s flag.

	* doc/id3libhistory.txt: 
	Rerformatted to fit within 80 characters.

1999-11-19  Scott Thomas Haug  <sth2@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/id3/tag_render.cpp
	(RenderV1ToHandle): Added.  Adds or overwrites an id3v1 tag to a file
	handle.  Needs testing.
	(RenderV2ToHandle): Renamed from RenderToHandle.

	* src/id3/tag_parse_v1.cpp 
	(ID3_RemoveTrailingSpaces): Minor code cleanup.
	(ParseID3v1): Massive recoding of method to make use of new functions
	defined in misc_support.  Simplifies flow of method.

	* src/id3/tag_find.cpp 
	(Find): Add const qualifier.

	* src/id3/tag_file.cpp 
	(Update): Changed parameter to be a flag which indicates which type of
	tag to update, either V1_TAG, V2_TAG, or BOTH_TAGS.  Updated method to
	act appropriately based on the parameter passed in.
	(Strip): Changed parameter to be a flag which indicates which type of
	tag to update, either V1_TAG, V2_TAG, or BOTH_TAGS.  Updated method to
	act appropriately based on the parameter passed in.

	* src/id3/tag.h: 
	Added new constants: STR_V1_COMMENT_DESC (to be added to the
	description of comments converted from id3v1 tags); V1_TAG,
	V2_TAG, and BOTH_TAGS (used for methods Strip and Update to
	determine which tag to act on); and LEN_V1, LEN_V1_ID,
	LEN_V1_TITLE, LEN_V1_ARTIST, LEN_V1_ALBUM, LEN_V1_YEAR,
	LEN_V1_COMMENT, LEN_V1_GENRE (the lengths of the id3v1 tag and its
	fields). Generalized ID3V1_Tag struct using newly defined
	constants.  Added 1 to each char array size for null terminator.
 	Added const qualifier to appropriate methods and parameters.
 	Added declaration of RenderV1ToHandle method.  Renamed
	"RenderToHandle" to "RenderV2ToHandle".

	* src/id3/misc_support.h: 
	Added the function declarations for ID3_GetString, ID3_GetArtist,
	ID3_GetAlbum, ID3_GetTitle, ID3_GetYear, ID3_AddYear,
	ID3_GetComment, ID3_AddComment, ID3_GetTrack, ID3_GetTrackNum,
	ID3_AddTrack, ID3_GetGenre, ID3_GetGenreNum, and ID3_GetLyrics.

	* src/id3/misc_support.cpp 
	(ID3_ASCIItoUnicode): Updated interface to make parameters const.  
	Replaced content of the code with call to mbstowcs, a function defined
	in wchar.h for converting from a regular string to a wchar string.  The
	original code might be reinstated if another type is used to store 
	unicode characters.
	(ID3_UnicodeToASCII): Updated interface to make parameters const.  
	Replaced content of the code with call to wcstombs, a function defined
	in wchar.h for converting from a wchar string to a regular string.  The
	original code might be reinstated if another type is used to store 
	unicode characters.
	(ID3_GetString): Added.  Returns a dynamically-allocated copy of the
	string contained in the frame/field parameters.
	(ID3_GetArtist): Added.  Returns the artist as a string.  Will return
	the LEADARTIST, the BAND, the CONDUCTOR, or the COMPOSER, whichever is
	found first in that order.
	(ID3_GetAlbum): Added.  Returns the album as a string.
	(ID3_GetTitle): Added.  Returns the song title as a string.

	(ID3_AddComment): Added. Adds the comment as a string with the
	description stored in STR_V1_COMMENT_DESC, currently "ID3v1_Comment".
	Won't add if a tag with that or no description already exists.

	(ID3_GetTrackNum): Added.  Returns the track number as an unsigned
	integer.
	(ID3_AddTrack): Added.  Adds the track number and track total as a
	string in the form "N/T", where N is the track number and T is the
	total.  If no total is indicated, then only the track number is added.
	(ID3_GetGenre): Added.  Returns the genre as a string.
	(ID3_GetGenreNum): Added. Returns the genre as a number.
	(ID3_AddGenre): Added.  Adds the genre number as a string in the form
	"(G)", where G is the genre number.
	(ID3_GetLyrics): Added.  Gets the unsynced lyrics as a string.

	* src/id3/field_string_unicode.cpp 
	(operator=): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(Set): Updated interface to make parameters const.  Bug fix for fixed
	length strings.  Minor variable renaming.
	(Add): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(Get): Updated interface to make parameters const.  Fixed bug which 
	would add a null character to the string regardless of the length of
	string requested.  Now only adds a null when the actual length of the
	string is less than the maxium number of characters requested.

	* src/id3/field_string_ascii.cpp 
	(operator=): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(Set): Updated interface to make parameters const.  Bug fix for fixed
	length strings.
	(Get): Removed check for nonempty strings so empty strings would be
	set correctly.  Minor code cleanup.
	(Add): Updated interface to make parameters const.  Made variable name
	more descriptive.

	* src/id3/field_integer.cpp 
	(ParseInteger): Updated interface to make parameters const.

	* src/id3/field_binary.cpp 
	(Set): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(FromFile): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(ToFile): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(ParseBinary): Updated interface to make parameters const.

	* src/id3/field.h 
	(class ID3_Field): Updated method interfaces to make appropriate
	parameters const.

	* src/id3/field.cpp
	(BinSize): Added check for an ascii string when called by Size, since
	we store every string internally as unicode.
	(Parse): Updated interface to make parameters const.
	(ID3_FindFrameDef): Updated interface to make parameter const.
	(ID3_FindFrameID): Updated interface to make parameter const.

	* src/id3/dll_wrapper.cpp
	(ID3Tag_Strip): Updated for interface change to
	Tag::Strip.  Now accepts tag flags rather than a v1 boolean.

	* src/examples/Makefile.am: 
	Added compilation options for demo_strip.cpp

	* src/examples/demo_info.cpp: 
	Added runtime options for version and help.  Minor code cleanup.

	* src/examples/demo_strip.cpp: Initial revision.

1999-11-16  Scott Thomas Haug  <sth2@cs.wustl.edu>

	* src/id3/tag_parse.cpp
	(ProcessBinaries): Added try/catch block to catch any exceptions so
	that the parser can carry on parsing the rest of the frames if any
	particular frame is poorly encoded.  Need to add some sort of
	mechanism to determine how many frames exist, how many have been 
	parsed correctly and how many have been parsed incorrectly.

	* src/id3/field_string_unicode.cpp
	(ParseUnicodeString): Put in sanity check for indices so that
	memcpy doesn't go out of bounds. Made unicode code more specific
	to the type of data storing unicode characters.  This fix doesn't
	work if the type is different than two bytes in size.  Need to fix
	so that the type is guaranteed to be two bytes.
	(RenderUnicodeString): Made unicode code more specific to the type
	of data storing unicode characters.
	
	* src/id3/field_string_ascii.cpp
	(ParseASCIIString): Added sanity check for indices so we don't
	call memcpy with out-of-bounds indices.

	* src/id3/field.cpp 
	(Render): Minor reformatting.

	* src/id3/error.h 
	(ID3_Err): Added new ID3_Err: ID3E_BadData.

	* src/id3/error.cpp 
	(ID3_ErrorDescs): Added text entry for ID3E_BadData.

1999-11-15  Scott Thomas Haug  <sth2@cs.wustl.edu>

	* configure.in
	* configure: 
	Changed the distribution version to 3.0.6pre1.

	* Makefile.am
	* Makefile.in: 
	Added EXTRA_DIST and moved EXTRA_SUBDIRS to SUBDIRS.

	* src/Makefile.am 
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added ChangeLog.
	(SUBDIRS): Added examples.

	* src/id3/Makefile.am: 
	Upped the version info to 3.0.6.

	* src/id3/tag_render.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Removed
	assignments from if checks; first makes assignment, then checks
	for appropriate value.  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.  Now uses mktemp rather than mkstemp in
	GenerateTempName so that a file descriptor isn't created along
	with the temporary name.

	* src/id3/tag_find.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Removed assignments from if checks;
	first makes assignment, then checks for appropriate value.  Made
	private member variable names more descriptive.  Major code
	cleanup: use of for loops instead of while's to ease code
	readability, more compact looping structures to reduce possibility 
	in coding or human parsing errors,

	* src/id3/tag_file.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Removed
	assignments from if checks; first makes assignment, then checks
	for appropriate value.  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.  OpenLinkedFile now checks to see if the file is
	writable or not, and still opens the file, even if it can't be
	written to.  This needs to be more robust (i.e., we shouldn't be
	creating temp files if the file isn't writable).  Made use of
	bFileWrtiable variable, which was introduced.
	
	* src/id3/tag.h:
	Made variable names more descriptive.  Added const qualifier to
	appropriate methods.
	
	* src/id3/int28.cpp: 
	Added include for config.h. Changed some ints to luints to avoid
	compiler warnings.

	* src/id3/header.h
	* src/id3/header_frame.h:
	Made variable names more descriptive.
	
	* src/id3/header.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Made private
	member variable names more descriptive.  Fixed bug I introduced in
	logic of checking version/revision numbers in
	ID3_LookupHeaderInfo, and cleaned up the code in the process.

	* src/id3/frame.h: 
	Made ID3_Tag a friend of ID3_Frame to allow access to the private
	members in ID3_Frame.  Made variable names more descriptive.
	Added const qualifier to appropriate methods.

	* src/id3/field_binary.cpp
	* src/id3/field_integer.cpp
	* src/id3/field_string_ascii.cpp
	* src/id3/field_string_unicode.cpp

	* src/id3/tag_parse_lyrics3.cpp
	* src/id3/tag_parse_v1.cpp
	* src/id3/tag_sync.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Removed
	assignments from if checks; first makes assignment, then checks
	for appropriate value.  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.

	* src/id3/field.h:
	Made ID3_Frame and ID3_Tag friends of the ID3_Field class to allow
	access to the private members in ID3_Field.  Made ID3FF field
	flags const luints, rather than #define's.  Made member variable
	names of classes and structs more descriptive.  
	
	* src/id3/field.cpp: 
	Added include for config.h.  Replaced LU_NULL with ID3FF_NONE for
	more consistency in flag naming.  Blocked out the ID3FD_Volume
	array definition since it is currently unused.  Reformatted
	ID3_FrameDefs for easier reading (although most lines are more
	than 80 chars long now).  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.  Fixed bug in SetVersion (was checking "rev != rev").
	Adjusted logic somewhat in BinSize to ease code reading.  Fixed
	bug in BinSize that was causing incorrect parsing of correct
	frames, such as COMM (previously assumed a wchar_t is 2 bytes,
	which might not be true on some platforms).

	* src/id3/error.h:
	Made constructor public.  Added new interface to error reporting
	to allow for more descriptive error messages (this should still be
	worked on).  Made private member variable names more descriptive.
	Added const qualifier to appropriate methods.

	* src/id3/error.cpp: 
	Added include for config.h.  Added new interface to error
	reporting to allow for more descriptive error messages (this
	should still be worked on).  Made private member variable names
	more descriptive. 

	* src/id3/dll_wrapper.cpp
	* src/id3/frame_parse.cpp
	* src/id3/header_tag.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Made variable names more descriptive.

	* src/id3/Makefile.am
	* src/id3/Makefile.in: 
	Updated versioning info and CXXFLAGS

	* src/examples/Makefile.am: 
	Added macros to allow for compiling test programs id3convert and 
	id3info.

	* src/examples/demo_convert.cpp: 
	More descriptive error message.

	* src/examples/demo_main.cpp: 
	Reformatted, dos2unix, cleaned up code, etc.

	* doc/Makefile.am 
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added doc files that are to be distributed.

	* m4/Makefile.am: 
	Adjusted so that the macros aren't installed.
