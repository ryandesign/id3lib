	* src/id3/tag_parse_v1.cpp
	(ParseID3v1): Minor fix for windows compatibility (thanks elrod).

	* src/id3/tag_file.cpp 
	(truncate): Added.  Defined only for windows, which doesn't have
	unistd.h available (thanks elrod).

	* src/id3/misc_support.cpp
	(ucslen): Now returns 0 if input is NULL (thanks elrod).

	* include/id3/misc_support.h: 
	Minor declaraction problem (thanks elrod).

	* configure.in: Upped the patch number to 1.

	* include/id3/Makefile.am
	* include/Makefile.am
	(EXTRA_DIST): Removed.  No extra files to distribute

1999-11-30  Scott Thomas Haug  <sth2@cs.wustl.edu>

	* README:
	Renamed ID3Lib to id3lib.

	* COPYING: 
	Renamed ID3Lib to id3lib.  Fixed spelling of "optimizations".

	* configure.in: 
	Minor modifications.  Removed call to SH_SIZE_SPECIFIC_TYPES---these
	types are now defined in src/id3/sized_types.h.  Removed ID3LIB_NAME
	macro (same as PACKAGE).  Removed ID3LIB_RELEASE macro (same as 
	VERSION).  Renamed ID3LIB_IDSTRING to ID3LIB_FULLNAME and removed
	the date part of it.

	* Makefile.am
	(EXTRA_DIST): Removed ChangeLog, configure, HISTORY, and TODO.  
	These are included in the distribution automatically.

	* configure.in: 
	Generalized versioning mechanism so it only has to be changed in this
	file to be propagated throughout rest of source code.  Used a hack to
	make libtool version coincide with release versioning.  This is
	expressly warned against in the libtool docs, so it might be changed.
	However, it also seems to be a common practice amongst other library
	writers, so I'm torn.  Added versioning macro definitions normally
	found in version.h.  Probably not the best place for this...
