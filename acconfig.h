// This file defines portability work-arounds for various proprietory

// Workaround for compilers with buggy for-loop scoping
// That's quite a few compilers actually including recent versions of
// Dec Alpha cxx, HP-UX CC and SGI CC.
// The trivial "if" statement provides the correct scoping to the 
// for loop

// If the C++ compiler we use doesn't have bool, then
// the following is a near-perfect work-around. 
// You must make sure your code does not depend on "int" and "bool"
// being two different types, in overloading for instance.
