	* Makefile.am: Upped the version info to 3.0.6.

	* tag_render.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Removed
 	assignments from if checks; first makes assignment, then checks
 	for appropriate value.  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.  Now uses mktemp rather than mkstemp in
	GenerateTempName so that a file descriptor isn't created along
	with the temporary name.

	* tag_find.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Removed assignments from if checks;
 	first makes assignment, then checks for appropriate value.  Made
 	private member variable names more descriptive.  Major code
	cleanup: use of for loops instead of while's to ease code
	readability, more compact looping structures to reduce possibility 
	in coding or human parsing errors,

	* tag_file.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Removed
 	assignments from if checks; first makes assignment, then checks
 	for appropriate value.  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.  OpenLinkedFile now checks to see if the file is
	writable or not, and still opens the file, even if it can't be
	written to.  This needs to be more robust (i.e., we shouldn't be
	creating temp files if the file isn't writable).  Made use of
	bFileWrtiable variable, which was introduced.
	
	* tag.h:
	Made variable names more descriptive.  Added const qualifier to
	appropriate methods.
	
	* int28.cpp: 
	Added include for config.h. Changed some ints to luints to avoid
	compiler warnings.

	* header.h, header_frame.h:
	Made variable names more descriptive.
	
	* header.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Made private
	member variable names more descriptive.  Fixed bug I introduced in
	logic of checking version/revision numbers in
	ID3_LookupHeaderInfo, and cleaned up the code in the process.

	* frame.h: 
	Made ID3_Tag a friend of ID3_Frame to allow access to the private
	members in ID3_Frame.  Made variable names more descriptive.
	Added const qualifier to appropriate methods.

	* field_binary.cpp, field_integer.cpp, field_string_ascii.cpp, field_string_unicode.cpp, frame.cpp, frame_render.cpp, header_frame.cpp, misc_support.cpp, tag.cpp, tag_parse.cpp, tag_parse_lyrics3.cpp, tag_parse_v1.cpp, tag_sync.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Minor code cleanup.  Removed
 	assignments from if checks; first makes assignment, then checks
 	for appropriate value.  Made private member variable names more
	descriptive.

	* field.h:
	Made ID3_Frame and ID3_Tag friends of the ID3_Field class to allow
 	access to the private members in ID3_Field.  Made ID3FF field
 	flags const luints, rather than #define's.  Made member variable
	names of classes and structs more descriptive.  
	
	* field.cpp: 
	Added include for config.h.  Replaced LU_NULL with ID3FF_NONE for
 	more consistency in flag naming.  Blocked out the ID3FD_Volume
 	array definition since it is currently unused.  Reformatted
 	ID3_FrameDefs for easier reading (although most lines are more
 	than 80 chars long now).  Made private member variable names more
 	descriptive.  Fixed bug in SetVersion (was checking "rev != rev").
  	Adjusted logic somewhat in BinSize to ease code reading.  Fixed
 	bug in BinSize that was causing incorrect parsing of correct
 	frames, such as COMM (previously assumed a wchar_t is 2 bytes,
	which might not be true on some platforms).

	* error.h:
	Made constructor public.  Added new interface to error reporting
 	to allow for more descriptive error messages (this should still be
 	worked on).  Made private member variable names more descriptive.
	Added const qualifier to appropriate methods.

	* error.cpp: 
	Added include for config.h.  Added new interface to error
 	reporting to allow for more descriptive error messages (this
 	should still be worked on).  Made private member variable names
	more descriptive. 

	* dll_wrapper.cpp, frame_parse.cpp, header_tag.cpp:
	Added include for config.h.  Made variable names more descriptive.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Updated versioning info and CXXFLAGS
