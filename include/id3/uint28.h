/** Class representation of an unsigned 28-bit integer for use in an ID3v2 tag.
 **
 ** The ID3v2 tag specification (http://www.id3.org) defines an unsigned 28-bit
 ** integer in which the most-significant bit in each of the integer's 4 bytes
 ** is set to 0.  This is done to avoid having integers in an id3v2 tag that
 ** might be mistaken for an MP3 sync-signal, which is why this representation
 ** is sometimes referred to as "syncsafe integers."
 **
 ** Since these 4 bits are unavailable as representation of the integer, this
 ** leaves 28 bits to define its value.  Therefore a uint28 object can
 ** represent values between 0 and 2^28-1 (or ~256M)
 **
 ** To be useful within id3lib's implementation of the ID3v2 spec, the uint28
 ** class enables instantiations to be created from and written to 4-byte (or
 ** more) character buffers.  In keeping with the ID3v2 spec, uint28 numbers
 ** use a big-endian byte ordering, such that the number 0x12345678 is
 ** represented as 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 in byte form.  A big-endian
 ** representation of 255, normally 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xFF for 32-bit integers,
 ** would be 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x7F for a 28-bit integer.
