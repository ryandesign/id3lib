== OVERVIEW ==

id3lib is a C++ class library for manipulating ID3v1/v1.1 and ID3v2 tags.

It also includes (or will include very soon now!) a functional C interface to
the library.

id3lib 3.x conforms to all ID3v2 standards up to and including the ID3v2-3.0
informal standard.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

In order to successfully compile and use id3lib, the following programs and
libraries are needed:

using:
----------
zlib

compiling:
----------
g++ 2.8/egcs 1.0.3 (or compatible) 
GNU make
autoconf 2.12
automake 1.4
zlib

== BRIEF HISTORY ==

id3lib was originally written by Dirk Mahoney, and the original web page for 
the id3lib project was http://www.id3lib.org.  Unfortunately, active public
development on the library concluded around November 1998.  According to the
id3lib page, development was taken over by MusicMatch, the company who produces
the Windows application MusicMatch Jukebox.  Unfortunately, no further open
development was made as a part of this handover of responsibility.  As the 
library is in the public domain, the project was forked at version 3.05a by
Scott Haug (sth2@cs.wustl.edu) to provide better linux/unix compatibility,
increased functionality, and the usual cavalcade of bug fixes.
